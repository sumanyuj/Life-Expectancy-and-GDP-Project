# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Project

This project aims to perform a data analysis of GDP and life expectancy from data of the World Bank and the World Health Organization. 

The dataset is a csv file that contains the GDP and life expectancy of six countries (Chile, Germany, Mexico, the United States of America, and Zimbabwe). 

I will use Python, and several of its popular data-oriented libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to create data visualizations that seek the find answers within the data.
